# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-Web-App
<!-- Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using RESNET-50 Adagrad Optimizer and integrated on the web using React and Django. -->

This project focuses on analyzing different stages of diabetic retinopathy using an APTOS dataset of 18,700 diabetic retinopathy images sourced from Kaggle. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we have employed the ResNet-50 architecture with the Adagrad optimizer to enhance our system's detection capabilities. 💪🔍

## Dataset
📚 The dataset utilized in this project consists of 18,700 diabetic retinopathy images obtained from Kaggle. These images form the foundation for training our deep learning model, enabling us to accurately identify and classify different stages of diabetic retinopathy.

## Model Architecture
🧠 To achieve superior performance in diabetic retinopathy detection, we have adopted the state-of-the-art ResNet-50 architecture. This deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model is widely recognized for its ability to extract intricate features from medical images, making it an ideal choice for our task. 🏥

## Training
🎯 Our ResNet-50 model underwent extensive training using the diabetic retinopathy dataset, undergoing multiple iterations and fine-tuning processes. Our primary objective was to maximize the model's accuracy and robustness in classifying various stages of diabetic retinopathy, ensuring reliable and precise diagnosis results. 📈

## Web Application
🌐 For seamless accessibility, we have integrated the diabetic retinopathy detection system into a user-friendly web application. This application combines the strengths of Django and React, providing users with a dynamic and interactive platform to upload diabetic retinopathy images and receive prompt detection results. 🖥️💻
